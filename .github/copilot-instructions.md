# Ko_gb Project - AI Coding Assistant Instructions

## Project Overview
This is a new project workspace. These instructions will be updated as the codebase develops.

## Architecture & Structure
*To be documented as the project architecture emerges*

## Development Workflows
*Document build processes, testing strategies, and deployment procedures as they're established*

## Code Conventions
*Document project-specific patterns and conventions as they develop*

## Key Integration Points
*Document external dependencies and service integrations as they're added*

## Getting Started for AI Assistants
1. Check for `package.json`, `requirements.txt`, or similar dependency files to understand the tech stack
2. Look for `README.md` for project setup instructions
3. Examine folder structure to understand component organization
4. Check for CI/CD configuration files (`.github/workflows/`, `azure-pipelines.yml`, etc.)

## Common Tasks
*Document frequent development tasks and their specific approaches in this project*

---
*This file should be updated as the project grows to include project-specific patterns, architectural decisions, and development workflows that would help AI assistants be immediately productive.*
